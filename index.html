      hiii! I don't know if makikita mo ba this (ang corny ko ba huhu). Don't worry, thank you card lang this, and I just don't know how else I will say this kasi. Thank you vv much for being the kindest and most understanding person during my lowest. 'wag mo na lang sana ipagkalat yung alam mo :(( Super grateful ako, and i dont think you know how much that means to me. Salamat!

     I am always rooting for you, future isko and atty!! For me, friend kita, and happy rin ako kapag may achievements ka. You can always share your pain and concerns with me (if u want to). Laban nang laban lang, Rainier! Proud kami agad sa'yo, failure or success, ups and downs! ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—
